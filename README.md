# Card Matching Game — DSA Implementation

A browser-based **Card Matching Game** that combines front-end design with low-level backend logic using **C and WebAssembly**. This project is designed to **implement and understand core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** like linked lists and stacks in an interactive and visual way.

---

## Project Purpose

- To apply DSA concepts like **Linked List** and **Stack** in a real-world interactive project.
- To connect C language code with web-based frontend using **WebAssembly**.
- To understand integration between low-level programming and high-level UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: C (compiled to WebAssembly)
- **Compiler**: Emscripten
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## DSA Concepts Implemented

- **Linked List** – To manage and track the order of cards.
- **Stack** – For undo/redo functionality (included but not implemented yet).

## How to Rebuild WebAssembly from C

> Make sure [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) is installed and activated.

### Step 1: Activate Emscripten

```
cd path/to/emsdk
emsdk install latest
emsdk activate latest
emsdk_env.bat  # On Windows
```
### Step 2: Compile C code to WASM
```
cd path/to/card-matching-game
emcc game.c -s WASM=1 -o game.js
```
- This command will regenerate: game.js | game.wasm
- These are essential for running the game in the browser.

---

### Debugging & Challenges
- WebAssembly Integration: Required careful handling using ccall and cwrap to bridge C and JS.

- CRLF Warnings: Handled line ending mismatches using Git config.

- Git Submodules: Accidentally added the emsdk/ directory, fixed using .gitignore.

- Index Bugs: Resolved mismatch between JS and C array indices during gameplay.

---

### Takeaways
- Learned how to use WebAssembly to execute C logic in the browser.

- Applied DSA concepts in a practical project.

- Learned full-stack integration from C to web frontend.

- Better understanding of Git workflows and managing large file trees.
